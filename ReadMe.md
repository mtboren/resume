#### **PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY**

Senior Architect with passion for doing the most with the least expenditure, presently via enterprise-scale automation and declarative infrastructure, and by maximizing positive impact through influence, mentoring, and collaboration. I have honed these skills over 20+ years, and I architect and engineer secure, compliant-by-design solutions that embrace "Everything as Code" principles across AWS and Azure environments, ensuring success through high velocity and consistency. And, I strive for ever-faster and ever-better by teaming up with emerging technologies.

#### **PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE**

**Enterprise Automation** team at Eli Lilly (Contracts via Virtusa in Indianapolis, IN)
Senior Architect, May 2022 to present

Lead teams towards greater success via consistency and automation:

* Thought leadership and mentoring, increasing velocity and improving outcomes through effective collaboration and problem prevention
* Maximize reliability, consistency, security: Describe and manage all possible things as code, such as resource definitions, security policies, deployment pipelines, ad-hoc deployment actions
* Empower others through clear, sufficient metadata / documentation for solutions, capabilities, and by emitting reusable building blocks for subsequent automation
* Helped establish operational governance and architectural guardrails for containerized Node.js applications, guiding developer teams to reduce downtime and streamline troubleshooting protocols

Examples and technologies:

* Multiply cross-functional capabilities by mentoring technicians and engineers, influencing teams across multiple business units and disciplines on as much of the "what" and "how" as possible
* Architect and standardize reusable CI/CD frameworks (GitHub Actions) to automate IaC (CloudFormation) lifecycles of AWS resource stacks
* Author automated testing of serverless functions with PowerShell Pester framework
* Define standard development containers in GitHub Codespaces for clean dev/PoC environments (via devcontainer.json definitions), maximizing developer velocity by eliminating initial setup friction
* Improve visibility by leveraging observability for applications (CloudWatch dashboards and alarms, Splunk for health clarity)
* Technologies: CloudFormation, Lambda, EC2, VPC, S3, EventBridge, IAM, ECS, PowerShell, Python, Git, CI/CD via GitHub Actions, PostgreSQL RDS, etc., Agile methodology (Scrum) for work visibility and prioritization.

**Hosting, Cloud Services Automation** team at Eli Lilly (Contract via Virtusa in Indianapolis, IN)
Automation Engineer, Oct 2018 to Mar 2022

Automated everything possible, from storage administration in the cloud, to serverless functions (AWS Lambda) for stitching together portions of solutions, to cloud management platform automation. Generally, Administration as Code, approaching Everything as Code. Things like:

* Infrastructure as code (IaC): Describing cloud-based solutions in AWS CloudFormation templates (YAML), for easy and automated deployment via PowerShell, and for versioning via Git/GitHub
* Enabled on-demand patching grouping by tagging of AWS Systems Manager (SSM) managed instances with data from AWS Relational Database Service (RDS) database instance
* Helped build patching solution for hybrid compute estate (12,000+ servers), queueing server patching data in a AWS SQS queue after patching and "popping" said data on demand
* Chronicling and sharing knowledge using Jupyter Notebooks for documentation plus code in versionable, modern format (notebooks with output from live examples)
* Collaborating with experts in other fields to automate their worlds, too: networking, storage, collaboration (SharePoint), identity (Active Directory), platform (Windows, Linux)
* Configuration management, artifact creation automation via things like Ansible and Packer

Additional examples of automating: defining Azure resources as code (PowerShell, ARM templates in JSON and Bicep), deployment/configuration automation for Amazon Machine Image (AMI) creation via Packer and HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL2), operating system configuration management via Ansible, data mining from F5 Networks appliances via API, identity management workflow automation, Cloud Management platform consumption via Morpheus Data APIs, vSphere data mining, task orchestration with Jenkins pipelining, Shell (Bash) code, and Python.

**Global Virtualization** team at Eli Lilly (Contract via Apparatus/Virtusa in Indianapolis, IN)
Automation Engineer, Infrastructure Specialist, Jun 2010 to Oct 2018

Automated, working across technologies with experts in other fields to spread the computational thought process, making other makers, force multiplying by spreading automation knowledge and support.

Designed, developed, and maintained the enterprise self-service / VM provisioning product in PowerShell and ASP.NET / C\# ("vmDeploy"), which took deployments from days/weeks to minutes. Successfully orchestrated deployment of tens of thousands of Windows and Linux VMs, and automated provisioning of enterprise storage to virtualization clusters (from LUNs to datastore clusters).

Enabled scaled management of global estate ranging from server virtualization to network virtualization to storage to VMware View virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI), with main objectives always being automation and an underlying theme of security. Created, maintained world class PowerShell modules and library of supporting scripts. Example: Created a data collection framework for VMware View reporting portal using PowerShell Remoting, VMware View PowerCLI, and SQL .NET

#### **EARLIER CAREER HIGHLIGHTS**

**Citrix, Novell, VMware** team at Sallie Mae, Fishers, IN
Systems Administrator, Aug 2004 to May 2010

Managed VMware environment, increasingly via PowerShell. Automated host build via KickStart-based provisioning. Employed VMware SRM for DR modernization. Automated support of Citrix XP/4.0 farms and configuration management of 100 Novell NetWare servers

Further highlights: low/no impact migrations, cost savings through automation ($40,000 savings with a single script that prevented 300 hours of consultant work), enabled user self-service by creating web-based printer maps, automated conversion of Citrix farms (\~900 published applications) from Novell-based publishing to Microsoft Active Directory-based publishing.

Additional examples: Data mining from Citrix farms, reporting of server utilization statistics, management of Novell eDirectory and Active Directory, PowerShell for HP iLO configuration.

**Workstation Management** team at Sallie Mae, Fishers, IN
Analyst, Feb 2001 to Aug 2004
